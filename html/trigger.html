<p style="text-align: center;">For the safety of the resort, equipment, and patrons, please remove the ice buildup before operations begin/resume.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If this is a false alarm, that is, the detector has been triggered and the build up of ice is not significant, please adjust the threshold and reset the device as the base conditions may not have been set properly due to fogging of the camera lens or a build up that was present during setting the initial state.</p>
